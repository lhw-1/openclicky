//
//  The permission card on the island: one permission at a time, a row of dashes for progress, a
//  headline, one line of copy, grant and later. On Windows the microphone is a permission
//  (Settings → Privacy & security → Microphone), and so is "Online speech recognition" (Settings →
//  Privacy & security → Speech), but only once Windows speech has refused to dictate without it.
//  Accessibility, Screen Recording and Screen Content have no Windows counterpart, so their steps,
//  the drag helper and the relaunch flows are gone.
