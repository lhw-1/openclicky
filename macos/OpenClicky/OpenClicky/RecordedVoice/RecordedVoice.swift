//  The lines OpenClicky says the same way every time, recorded once in its answering voice
//  (OpenAI speech, marin) and bundled, so they sound good with no key and no network: the
//  first-run tour's narration, and the notices that used to be read by the Mac's system voice
//  ("i didn't get an answer…"). Anything not recorded here is spoken the way it was before.
