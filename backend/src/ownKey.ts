 * anonymous "byok" principal: it reaches only the model routes, on the user's keys (resolveProviderKeys
 * switches on the same header, so the backend's keys are never used), and is never metered or rate
 * limited: it is the person's key and the person's bill, and OpenClicky is free to use with one.
 *
 * A request that does carry an Authorization header is judged by that header alone: a bad token is
 * a 401, never a quiet fall back to anonymous.
